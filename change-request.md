# Project Name: Personal Introduction Page
## Requested By: Greg Gamel

## Proposed Change
Add an embeded map from Windy, that is customized to the website subject's location, which will display weather conditions in the specified area including, Wind speed and direction, Temperature, Measurements of precipitation
This will require:
- Finding the adequte location on the map using the Windy webpage.
- Customizing the setting to display user freindly units of measurement for various weather readings.
- Embedding the provided code in to the webpage HTML document.
- Pushing the changes to GitHub and writing out commit statements for said changes.

## Reason for the Change
The instructor has requested this because it provides more information about the website subject's location as well as real time updates about the weather in that specified location. 

## How This Change will Add Value
The instructor feels more personalized information about the website's subject, therefore making to more personalized to the subject.

## How This Change will Affect the Constraints
### Time
I estimate this would add another thirty minutes of time to push back the project deadline. While it will not take log to embed the map it self, making sure the format of the wepage is presentable will add time to trouble shoot.
### Quality
This feature will add more personal infromation about the webpages's subject, but may provide information that puts the website's subject at risk and may cause safety issues.
### Budget
This feature would not add any cost to the budget but may require more time planing to provide.
