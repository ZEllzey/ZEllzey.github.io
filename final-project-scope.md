# Project Name: Zoe's Library

## Project Purpose
To provide an easily accessable catolog of my personal librabry that will allow me to view information about the books I have, for example title, genre, length, and "to be read" status. This will allow me to make informed desicions about what to read next.

## Description
I want to included a sorted catolog abiut all the specific about the books I own. This will display the books title, genre, author, page count, and if I have read the book or not. I will have to manually catalog and input this information by hand so it will be accessable.

## Desired Results
Create a way to catalog the books I have read and those I plan to read and be able to view my options easily. This will prove useful while I no longer have to tear my bookshelf apart to find the book I want to read next.

## Exclusions
This will not include pictures of the individual books or extensive descriptions of the content matter as doing so would require to much time to impliment.

## Priorities
This must be completed before the project 3 deadline and started as soon as possible. The finished project must be organized and presentable, does not need to be asthetically pleasing, but easy to follow. Shoulld not cost anything except a small bugdet of time to complete the project goals.

## Acceptance Criteria
The project will be approved to submit by myself upon satifactory completion, and will be evaluated after the deadline by the class Instructor.
